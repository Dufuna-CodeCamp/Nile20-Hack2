            <h1> Mobile App Developer</h1>
            <p>
                The mobile application industry is vast and is only expected to grow in the coming years. In fact, research suggests that the total value of the mobile app industry will increase to $188.9 billion in 2020.
                With this growth, the market will be very profitable. You can make a mobile app for your own enterprise or you can start a career in mobile app development.
                You don’t have to go back to college and study for a computer science degree. Of course, you can do that, but it will take a lot of time and money. That’s why we have decided to lay out an actionable guide for you to become an app developer.
            </p>
            <h1> How to Become a Mobile App Developer</h1>
            <p>
                The very first step towards learning to develop a mobile application is to choose a major platform. You will find plenty, such as Android, iOS, Windows, Symbian, and Blackberry RIM. However, it’s clear that Android and iOS are dominating the mobile industry. Windows 10 apps may still be relevant, but it’s still not the most profitable platform. Thus, it would be a wise choice to start your journey by opting either for iOS apps or Android apps.
                One is entirely different from the other. You need to consider which one you want to specialize in. Of course, you can attempt to master everything, but that’s not recommended. It’s better to cover only one, and then gradually expand your horizon to include other app developing platform as well.
            </p>
            <h1>Mastering the Coding Skills</h1>
            <h2>For iOS,</h2>
            <p>
                You will need to learn Swift or Objective-C. But how do you choose? That depends solely on the reason why you are learning mobile app development.
                If you are learning to develop apps to create your own products, then Swift would be a wise choice. Swift was introduced in 2014 and since then, it has received mostly positive feedback.
                However, if you are planning to become an iOS developer for a mobile app development company, the best choice might learn Objective-C first. Primarily because tons of documentation is meant for Objective-C, and there are still thousands of iOS apps out there built with Objective-C. You may need it to maintain or fix the code.
                Apple offers the iOS Developer Library, which is very well-documented. You will find many tutorials and videos to help you learn to code. It helps you break down the complexity of the iOS development program into small basic parts for easy understanding. In fact, there are many great blogs on iOS development.
            </p>
            <h2>For Android,</h2>
            <p>
                To develop apps on the Android platform, you need to know Java or Kotlin. For those who have no clue how it works, you will need an introductory course to the programming language Java. The best place to begin is Google’s Android Developer Library. Again, these are extremely well-documented and have a comprehensive set of training materials.
                Before you decide to choose Android, you should be aware of the fact that there are many different types of Android devices on the market. It can cause a bit of complication in the beginning. But once you get past it, you will have the potential to reach a wider market.
